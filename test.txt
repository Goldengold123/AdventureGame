## Inspiration
I use Discord very often and I noticed that there were few game bots.
## What it does
p!game to play an RPG game.
## How I built it
- Python Discord API (discord.py)
- PyCharm for making the code
## Challenges I ran into
My code editor had a monospaced font, whereas Discord had a different font. This led to spacing issues when creating the text that was to be shown, such as the map.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Managing to create a simple game in such a short period of time.
## What I learned
I learned how to use discord.py more fluently.
## What's next for Adventure Game
More clean outputs - considering using embeds, more emojis, etc.
